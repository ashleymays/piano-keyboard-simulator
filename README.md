    <strong>Update: </strong>I'm working on a new version for this app, including a complete redesign and hosting it online. It'll also feature an updated tech stack and storing the audio files in cloud storage rather than in the file system. Right now it's about 60% done, and I hope to be done by the end of August 2024.
