# Play piano in your browser.

PianoSim is a virtual piano keyboard that can be played with a computer keyboard or a mouse. Play one of four different instrument sounds and mimic the sustain and soften pedals on a grand piano. You can also record your playing and use it as a backing track.

Special thanks to Milan Maheshwari for their Skeumorphic Keyboard design on Figma.com, which this project took much of its inspiration from.
